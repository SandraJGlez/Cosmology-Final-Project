# Cosmology: Final Project
In this project we explore how the Bayesian inference is used in cosmology and astrophysics. We are going to develop the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in Python and test it on a straight line, using the slope (m) and y-axis intercept (b) as free parameters. Subsequently, we will test this code on the modulus distance equation for the supernovae data from Kowalski's paper (2008), and compare it qualitatively with the results of a \chi^2 minimization. For the latter, we will use \Omega_m and \Omega_\Lambda as free parameters, and the Cosmolopy library in Python to get the \chi^2 minimization.
